# Project-2_AppointmentBooking
For your second project you will need to complete a project that demonstrates the skills in PHP that you have learned so far.

Your project must include basic php fundamentals.
Your project must include some type of form.
Your project must include a database component.
Your project should make use of cookies and sessions.
Your project should be broken down using object-oriented concepts.
Your project should have a good appearance. (You can use bootstrap, foundation, or your own CSS)
For the project, you can pitch your own idea to me, or utilize one of my suggestions below. For either option, you have the option of working alone, or in a team of no more than 3 people. Keep in mind, if you are in a team you will need to have work-loads befitting a team project (i.e. a team can't do the same work as an individual would be expected to do, and expect to receive full credit.) This is not meant to discourage teams by any means, but instead to make sure we are all on equal footing.

Sample projects could include:

A blog.
A private portfolio working with real data.
A project that you pitch to me.
