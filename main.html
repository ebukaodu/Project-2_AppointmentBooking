            <p>I am involved with Intervarsity (IV). Intervarsity is a Christian student
                organization on Weber State campus. We meet every Thursdays to study the bible
                and meet new people from different backgrounds, cultures, and countries. Not only
                do we study the bible, we also play games and dine as a united group on campus.
                I am one of the leaders of the group because of my ambition to becoming a better,
                honest, and role model for my fellow peers.
            </p>
            <p>Over the year my life has been filled with different choices and doubts
                as to what I really like, but as I paved towards collage, my interest has been
                narrowed down to certainty. My interest are channeled towards computer programming,
                softwares, data creation and manipulation. All these are combinations of my hobbies.
                I really admire the fact that I have the chance to meet new people in my Intervarsity
                group and hangout with them. During the past years, I’ve realized that meeting new people
                has been a great blessing towards my spiritual and social life. Speaking about meeting
                new people, I’ve seen the opportunity to interact with my fellow Christian students. I also have
                a Bible Study group I lead in the dorms, which is very awesome. <br />

            <h3>Hiking</h3>
            <p>Having a lot friends who are out going, I have come to like hiking. Utah has a lot events
                to do and I enjoy hanging out with my friends both the Christians one and non-Christian friends.

            <h3>Playing Soccer </h3>
            <p>I use to make fun of Americans about soccer.  I tell my friends that the real name is football
                because it is played with the foot. Coming from a foreign country, made me to love soccer as many
                here in the U.S. are not soccer fans. I joined Weber Soccer team and became a goalkeeper. Although,
                sometimes, my education comes in-between my practices. Right now, I have quit the team to focus on my studies.
